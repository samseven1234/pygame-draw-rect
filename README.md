This is a very simple, satisfying project.

This was created with PyGame library that enable us
To load images, and creating a rect objects.

After running main.py, you can now click anywhere
And some rect objects will appear at the position
Of your cursor. At the top left corner, you can see
An undo image (button), which will erase the previous action.
Also you can see a rect count which is the count
Of rect objects that you draw, a color code (rgb),
And the live position of your cursor.

Thanks for Using!, Have a nice Day, God Bless.
